Joe: "I have an xlsx file with a bunch of numbers in rows, but I want them all in the same column. Can you help me stack them on top of each other?"

GPT4: "Of course! You can accomplish this task using Python and the pandas library. First, you need to install pandas and openpyxl (if you haven't already) by running this command in your terminal:"
```bash
pip install pandas openpyxl
```
"Now, you can use the following Python script to stack the numbers in the rows of your xlsx file into a single column:"
```python
import pandas as pd

# Read the xlsx file
input_file = 'your_file.xlsx'  # Replace with your file's name
output_file = 'output_file.xlsx'  # Replace with the desired output file name
df = pd.read_excel(input_file, engine='openpyxl')

# Stack the rows into a single column
stacked_df = df.stack().reset_index(drop=True).to_frame()

# Rename the column
stacked_df.columns = ['values']

# Write the output to a new xlsx file
stacked_df.to_excel(output_file, engine='openpyxl', index=False)
```
"Replace 'your_file.xlsx' with the name of your xlsx file and 'output_file.xlsx' with the name you want for the output file. This script will read your input file, stack the rows into a single column, and write the output to a new xlsx file."

Then I made a couple changes and it was done! Worked right away.
